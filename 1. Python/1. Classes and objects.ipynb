    "**Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. Essentially, it’s a way to bundle data and functionality together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",

    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `Dog` is a class.\n",
    "- `__init__` is a special method called a constructor that initializes new instances of the class.\n",
    "- `self` refers to the instance of the class itself. It’s used to access attributes and methods of the class.\n",
    "- `name` and `age` are attributes.\n",
    "- `bark` is a method.\n",

    "**Object**\n",

    "my_dog = Dog(name=\"Buddy\", age=3)\n",

    "### What is oops concept :\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" that contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods or functions). OOP is fundamental in many programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, and C#. The primary concepts of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class**:\n",
    "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "   - Example: A class `Car` may have attributes like `color`, `model`, and `year` and methods like `start()` and `stop()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object**:\n",
    "   - An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.\n",
    "   - Example: `myCar` can be an object of the class `Car` with specific values for `color`, `model`, and `year`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class, restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "   - This is often achieved using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public` to control access to the attributes and methods.\n",
    "   - Example: In the `Car` class, the attribute `engineNumber` can be kept private so that it cannot be modified directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class (child or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (parent or base class).\n",
    "   - This promotes code reusability.\n",
    "   - Example: A class `ElectricCar` can inherit from the `Car` class and have additional attributes like `batteryCapacity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name.\n",
    "   - This can be achieved through method overriding (inherited class overrides a method from the parent class) or method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).\n",
    "   - Example: The method `start()` in `Car` may work differently in `ElectricCar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "   - This simplifies the interaction with the object and reduces complexity.\n",
    "   - Example: When using a `Car` object, the driver doesn't need to know how the engine works internally; they just need to know how to start the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts work together to make OOP a powerful way to structure and manage code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

    "### what is an object in oops\n",
    "\n",
    "An object in OOP is an instance of a class that encapsulates both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). It represents a real-world entity, allowing you to model and manipulate data in a structured and meaningful way within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an **object** is a fundamental unit that represents an instance of a class. An object combines data and behavior in a single entity. Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Key Characteristics of an Object:***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance of a Class**:\n",
    "   - An object is created based on a class, which acts as a blueprint. The class defines the structure and behavior (i.e., attributes and methods) that the object will have.\n",
    "   - Example: If you have a class `Car`, an object `myCar` created from this class might have specific attributes like `color: red`, `model: Tesla Model 3`, and `year: 2023`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attributes (State)**:\n",
    "   - These are the data or properties that describe the object. The attributes are defined by the variables in the class.\n",
    "   - Example: For the `myCar` object, attributes could include `color`, `model`, and `year`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Methods (Behavior)**:\n",
    "   - These are the functions or operations that the object can perform, as defined by the methods in the class.\n",
    "   - Example: The `myCar` object might have methods like `start()`, `accelerate()`, and `brake()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identity**:\n",
    "   - Each object has a unique identity, meaning that even if two objects have the same state (same attribute values), they are considered distinct entities.\n",
    "   - Example: If you have two objects `myCar` and `yourCar`, both created from the `Car` class with identical attributes, they are still two separate objects with distinct identities."

    "\n",
    "1. **Polymorphism**: \n",
    "   - Polymorphism in programming allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It primarily occurs when a child class has a method with the same name as a method in the parent class. This allows for different implementations of the method depending on the object calling it.\n",

    "   - You have three classes: `mother`, `father`, and `son`.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Method Overriding**:\n",
    "   - In the `mother` class, there is a method `nose()` that returns `\"point\"`.\n",
    "   - In the `son` class, the same method `nose()` is overridden to return `\"amma kanaku\"`.\n",
    "   - This is an example of polymorphism. Even though the `son` class inherits the `nose()` method from the `mother` class, the `son` class has its own implementation of the `nose()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Demonstration**:\n",
    "   - If you create an instance of the `son` class and call the `nose()` method, it will return `\"amma kanaku\"` instead of `\"point\"`, which shows that the `son` class's `nose()` method overrides the `mother` class's `nose()` method.\n",

    "**Output explanation**\n",

    "print(s.ears())  # Output: \"ketkathu\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Explanation of the Output**:\n",
    "  - `s.nose()` calls the overridden method in the `son` class, so it returns `\"amma kanaku\"`.\n",
    "  - `s.hair()` calls the method from the `father` class, returning `\"black_color\"`.\n",

    "## Abstraction : \n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is another key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts. Abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points of Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hiding Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Abstraction simplifies complex systems by allowing developers to work with higher-level concepts and hiding the underlying implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**:\n",
    "   - Abstraction is typically implemented using abstract classes and interfaces. In Python, abstract classes are provided by the `abc` module (Abstract Base Class).\n",
    "   - An abstract class can have one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented in the abstract class. Subclasses that inherit from the abstract class must implement these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages of Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - **Simplicity**: By abstracting away unnecessary details, you can work with more straightforward and understandable concepts.\n",
    "   - **Modularity**: Abstraction leads to more modular code, where components can be developed, tested, and debugged independently.\n",
    "   - **Reusability**: Abstract classes and interfaces allow you to define common interfaces for different implementations, leading to reusable code.\n",
    "   - **Maintenance**: Changes in implementation details do not affect the higher-level code that interacts with the abstracted parts.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract Class (`Vehicle`)**:\n",
    "   - The `Vehicle` class is an abstract class that defines the abstract methods `start_engine` and `stop_engine`. These methods don’t have any implementation in the `Vehicle` class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Concrete Classes (`Car` and `Motorcycle`)**:\n",
    "   - The `Car` and `Motorcycle` classes inherit from the `Vehicle` abstract class and provide concrete implementations for the `start_engine` and `stop_engine` methods.\n",
    "   - These concrete classes must implement the abstract methods; otherwise, Python will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction in Action**:\n",
    "   - The details of how the engine is started and stopped are abstracted away in the `Vehicle` class. Users of the `Car` or `Motorcycle` classes only need to know that they can start and stop the engine; they don’t need to know how it’s done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "Abstraction in Python allows you to define the essential features of an object while hiding the implementation details. This makes it easier to manage complexity in large systems, promotes code reusability, and enhances maintainability. By using abstract classes and methods, Python enables developers to create well-organized and modular code.\n",
