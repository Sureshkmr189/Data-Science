    "# Types of Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions can be categorized based on how they are defined, their purpose, and their behavior. Here's an overview of the main types of functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Built-in Functions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: These are pre-defined functions that are available in Python's standard library. You can use them without needing to define them.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, `max()`, `sum()`.\n",
    "   - **Usage**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(\"Hello, World!\")  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
    "     length = len([1, 2, 3])  # Output: 3\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **User-defined Functions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: These are functions that you define yourself using the `def` keyword. They allow you to encapsulate and reuse code.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def greet(name):\n",
    "         return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "     message = greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: \"Hello, Alice!\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are usually used for short, simple operations and can have any number of arguments but only one expression.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     square = lambda x: x ** 2\n",
    "     result = square(5)  # Output: 25\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Recursive Functions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A recursive function is one that calls itself in order to solve a problem. It typically includes a base case to prevent infinite recursion.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def factorial(n):\n",
    "         if n == 1:\n",
    "             return 1\n",
    "         else:\n",
    "             return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "     result = factorial(5)  # Output: 120\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Higher-order Functions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments, return a function, or both. They allow for more abstract and flexible code.\n",
    "   - **Examples**: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def add_one(x):\n",
    "         return x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "     numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "     result = list(map(add_one, numbers))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Generator Functions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Generator functions return an iterator that yields a sequence of values lazily, one at a time, using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def count_up_to(n):\n",
    "         count = 1\n",
    "         while count <= n:\n",
    "             yield count\n",
    "             count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "     counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
    "     for num in counter:\n",
    "         print(num)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Decorated Functions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Decorated functions are functions that have been wrapped with a decorator, which is a function that takes another function and extends or modifies its behavior.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "         def wrapper():\n",
    "             print(\"Something before the function.\")\n",
    "             func()\n",
    "             print(\"Something after the function.\")\n",
    "         return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "     @my_decorator\n",
    "     def say_hello():\n",
    "         print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     say_hello()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Output**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Something before the function.\n",
    "     Hello!\n",
    "     Something after the function.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Method Functions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: These are functions defined inside a class, intended to be called on instances of that class. They can be instance methods, class methods, or static methods.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class MyClass:\n",
    "         def instance_method(self):\n",
    "             return \"Instance method called\", self\n",
    "\n",
    "         @classmethod\n",
    "         def class_method(cls):\n",
    "             return \"Class method called\", cls\n",
    "\n",
    "         @staticmethod\n",
    "         def static_method():\n",
    "             return \"Static method called\"\n",
    "\n",
    "     obj = MyClass()\n",
    "     print(obj.instance_method())  # Output: ('Instance method called', <MyClass object at ...>)\n",
    "     print(MyClass.class_method())  # Output: ('Class method called', <class '__main__.MyClass'>)\n",
    "     print(MyClass.static_method())  # Output: Static method called\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Async Functions (Coroutines)**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Async functions are defined with the `async def` syntax and are used for writing asynchronous code. They can be paused and resumed, allowing for non-blocking operations. These functions are often used with the `await` keyword.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "     async def say_hello():\n",
    "         print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "         await asyncio.sleep(1)\n",
    "         print(\"World\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     asyncio.run(say_hello())\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Output**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Hello\n",
    "     (1 second pause)\n",
    "     World\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Built-in Functions**: Provided by Python's standard library, available globally.\n",
    "- **User-defined Functions**: Created by the user using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "- **Lambda Functions**: Small, anonymous functions using the `lambda` keyword.\n",
    "- **Recursive Functions**: Functions that call themselves.\n",
    "- **Higher-order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.\n",
    "- **Generator Functions**: Functions that yield values one at a time using `yield`.\n",
    "- **Decorated Functions**: Functions that are modified by decorators.\n",
    "- **Method Functions**: Functions that are part of a class and are called on class instances.\n",
    "- **Async Functions**: Functions for writing asynchronous, non-blocking code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of function serves different purposes and is useful in various contexts depending on the specific needs of the code."

    "A function without arguments in Python is a function that doesn't require any input parameters to execute. These functions are often used when the task they perform doesn't depend on any external data, or they can operate with data that is already available within the function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Function Without Arguments\n",
    "Here's how you can define and use a function without arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **`greet()`**: The function `greet` is defined without any parameters inside the parentheses.\n",
    "- **`print(\"Hello, World!\")`**: Inside the function, it simply prints the message \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling the Function:\n",
    "To use this function, simply call it by its name followed by parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greet()  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases:\n",
    "1. **Simple Greetings**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def welcome_message():\n",
    "       print(\"Welcome to our platform!\")\n",

    "\n",
    "   show_current_time()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Static Calculations or Operations**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def display_pi():\n",
    "       print(\"The value of pi is approximately 3.14159\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   display_pi()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Functions without arguments are useful when the function’s behavior does not depend on any external input.\n",
    "- These functions are called by their name followed by parentheses `()`.\n",
    "- They are often used for tasks like printing messages, displaying static information, or performing operations that don't require input data.\n",

    "A function with arguments in Python is a function that takes one or more inputs (arguments) when called. These arguments allow the function to operate on external data passed to it, making the function more flexible and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Function with Arguments\n",
    "Here’s how you can define and use a function with arguments:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **`def greet(name):`**: The function `greet` is defined with one argument, `name`. This argument acts as a placeholder for the value that will be provided when the function is called.\n",
    "- **`print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")`**: Inside the function, the `print` statement uses the `name` argument to print a personalized greeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling the Function:\n",
    "When calling a function with arguments, you must provide the necessary values for those arguments:\n",
    "\n",
