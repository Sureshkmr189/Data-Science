    "## Python Data type \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, data types are categories that specify the type of data a variable can hold. Python has several built-in data types. Hereâ€™s an overview of the most commonly used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Basic Data Types***\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integers (`int`):**\n",
    "   - Whole numbers, positive or negative, without a decimal point.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 5\n",
    "   y = -3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Floating-Point Numbers (`float`):**\n",
    "   - Numbers with a decimal point or in exponential (scientific) notation.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 5.7\n",
    "   y = -3.14\n",
    "   z = 2e4  # 2 * 10^4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Numbers (`complex`):**\n",
    "   - Numbers with a real and an imaginary part.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 1 + 2j\n",
    "   y = complex(3, -4)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Booleans (`bool`):**\n",
    "   - Represents `True` or `False`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   is_active = True\n",
    "   has_value = False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Strings (`str`):**\n",
    "   - Ordered sequences of characters, enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   message = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   multiline = \"\"\"This is a\n",
    "   multi-line string.\"\"\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lists (`list`):**\n",
    "   - Ordered, mutable collections of items, enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, \"apple\", 4.5]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tuples (`tuple`):**\n",
    "   - Ordered, immutable collections of items, enclosed in parentheses.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, \"banana\", 4.5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ranges (`range`):**\n",
    "   - Represents an immutable sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_range = range(1, 10)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sets (`set`):**\n",
    "   - Unordered collections of unique items, enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3, \"apple\"}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frozen Sets (`frozenset`):**\n",
    "   - Immutable version of sets.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3, \"banana\"])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dictionaries (`dict`):**\n",
    "   - Unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures are fundamental to programming and are used in almost every program or software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. Arrays have a fixed size and elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stacks**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Operations are performed on the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Queues**: A linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Trees**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes. A common example is a binary tree, where each node has at most two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges. Graphs can be used to represent various real-world systems like networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Hash Tables**: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Hash tables offer efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Heaps**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is often used to implement priority queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Tries**: A type of search tree used to store a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Data Structures:\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: They allow for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Well-chosen data structures can scale with increasing amounts of data.\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Effective use of data structures can lead to optimized memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and choosing the right data structure is crucial for solving different types of problems efficiently."
